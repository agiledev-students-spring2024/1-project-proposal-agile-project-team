# Money Saver!
Navid Chowdhury
### What and why?
I would like to build a mobile wep application that can help college students to budget their spending. Many students are living on their own for the first time and may not know how to properly manage finances or save money for a rainy day.

### For whom?
This app will be targeted towards college students. Financial literacy is not taught in most public schools throughout the country. Additionally, after arriving at college it may be stressful to learn how to manage things such as money on your own. 

### How?

The user can enter how much money they currently have saved up and a goal they would like to work towards. The app will then ask for their income and spending and calculate how much they need to keep to reach their goal by their designated time frame. The user can also enter how much they spend each day. If it's determined they are going over their budget the app will give suggestions on what to do. If they are within their budget, then the app can give words of encouragement. The user can recieve small stickers (virtual) as rewards for proper budgeting.
### Scope

This main focus of this app in development would need to be coming up with a design that helps the user to be able to clearly understand their finances. This means that displaying information and front end development will take more time than backend. This can include things such as a pie chart of how money is being spent, charts for money coming in vs money going out, and a list of recent purchases. Additionally, things such as suggestions and words of encouragement may be taken from an API which would involve backend work as well. I believe that this is manageable for a group of 4-6 developers to complete in 1 semester.
